When talking about clothing, this type of simplicity usually comes with the removing of unnecessary details and additions made in the first place. Things added to make the garment “more” in the hope of making it relevant."

Often times these people were artists or worked within the creative industries and had practical needs. Not to mention they also looked damn cool which meant they knew a thing or two about style. They needed their clothes to be hard wearing as well as comfortable. \n\nAnd so the “R” Shirt was born, inspired by artists and everyday life. With a well-balanced collar, a comfortable but flattering silhouette and two pockets to keep your trinkets in it is not only good looking but comfortable and easy to wear. A shirt that just is what it is and cannot be this and that and that and that. The shirt you reach for every day."
