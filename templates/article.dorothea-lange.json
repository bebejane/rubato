        "text": "She is most famous for being the lens towards the American people during the depression era. Her intimate and very real photos of real people and their struggles was an eye opener and a document of the times of significant magnitude. \n\nPerhaps her most famous picture is one of Florence Owens Thompson called ‘Migrant Mother’ from 1936 \n(see picture below). It portrays a mother with her three children clinging to her as she gazes out into nothingness. It’s a picture that has been etched into the mind of most people but a lesser-known body of work by Dorothea Lange is her coverage of the Japanese Internment Camps that were put into effect after the bombing of Pearl Harbor."
