The idea of using a very robust cotton, except the obvious perk of longevity, was the fact that it would keep a crease better thus making it suitable to wear with more dressed up attire. If you wished to wear them more casually it was easy, just wash them as much as you want to remove the crease."

I would love to one day have some RTW items available in the atelier to complement our bespoke at a more accessible price point.\n\nI think now and in the future bespoke has to be truly exemplary in the quality of the make and just turning out any old hand made garment isn’t really enough anymore.\nWe work with a super talented young inspiring team, so over the next ten years it would be incredible to teach more young people and grow our in house team."
