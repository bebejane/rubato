Why are you wearing that?” They’re genuinely interested, which is nice, but also genuinely puzzled. \n  \nI like to think they can spot a fake a mile away. They’re so used to the posing of their peers - that teenage uncertainty and groping for identity - that they instantly spot when I’m not comfortable. When I’m not myself. Like a boy with a new earring who won’t stop tugging at it. \n\nThe elder two, in particular, pick up on the subtlest of styling. They were big fans of some red-and-blue vintage Nike trainers I bought last year, greeting them with a little ‘oo’ of surprise. But when I tried them with linen trousers, they weren’t so sure. There was an angling of the head, a slight wrinkling of the nose, and by the end of the day I agreed."

Not with a suit and tie, perhaps, but on a rainy day with a big raincoat, perfect. \n\nThere are open and inquiring minds at work here. No malice, no bias, just a really high level of observation. The kind that doesn’t gloss over any of the familiar in the world, as people tend to do as they get older. \n\nIt may surprise readers to think that a menswear writer, even ‘stylist’, should be at the mercy of their children. But I think they just have good, grounded taste. They also know me really well. They’ve grown up with who I am, they accept and cherish it, and they’re keenly aware of the context we live in. They, like me, want the two to exist in playful harmony: free to express ourselves, rather than trying to express someone else."
