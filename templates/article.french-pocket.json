I love so many different styles and subcultures that I wouldn’t dream of wearing (punk, terrace wear, \ngoth, hip hop etc..). \n\nThe older I get the more I’ve refined my style, I know what I like and what suits me. I gravitate to makers, clothing or brands that have some kind of story or history to them. I love finding out the process someone went through to achieve a particular dye or in your case (Rubato) hearing about that famous first trip to Scotland to get exactly the fit you wanted with no compromise. \n\nI’m not so much interested in how old a brand or tailor is but way more important to me is the actual product and effort gone into making it. \n\nTailoring, denim and a few slightly more obscure Japanese brands just seem to work with my principles and aesthetic.  I do like to try new, maybe slightly odd or eccentric pieces in to the mix and maybe it doesn’t always work, but if you don’t try something you’ll never know!"

I would love to one day have some RTW items available in the atelier to complement our bespoke at a more accessible price point.\n\nI think now and in the future bespoke has to be truly exemplary in the quality of the make and just turning out any old hand made garment isn’t really enough anymore.\nWe work with a super talented young inspiring team, so over the next ten years it would be incredible to teach more young people and grow our in house team."
